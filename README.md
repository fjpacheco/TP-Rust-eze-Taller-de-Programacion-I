# Redis Database in Rust

## First Part

An implementation of [Redis database](https://redis.io/).

Redis is a (mainly) in-memory storage, used as a Database of type key-value in memory, as well as cache and message broker, with persistence option of the data.

- Three different types of data structures: strings, lists, sets
- Keys expiration
- Periodic persistence of data to disk storage (snapshots feature)
- Publishers/subscribers functionality
- Garbage collector: lazy and periodic deletion

All this project was made using technics as: Automated Unit Testing, Automated Integration Tests using a Redis client to the Rust language [(an external crate)](https://crates.io/crates/redis), Error Handling and versions control.

# Redis HTTP Monitor in Rust

## Second Part

The web server that receives requests from browsers, communicating with them through the HTTP/1.1 protocol. The description of this protocol is the one corresponding to [RFC 2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616).
